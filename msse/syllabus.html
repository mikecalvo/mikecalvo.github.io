	<td class="description">
This course is an in-depth discussion of the challenges and complexities involved in designing and implementing modern
web applications.  Students will gain experience designing and implementing a project during in the course of the semester.
This process will give students experience with the following concepts:
<ul>
	<li>Domain-driven design, persistence techniques and transactions</li>
	<li>Web services using REST patterns</li>
	<li>Model-View-Controller design patterns</li>
	<li>Single page web applications</li>
	<li>Responsive web design</li>
	<li>Agile development frameworks</li>
	<li>Unit testing</li>
	<li>Dynamic programming languages</li>
</ul>
Equal time will be spent on server and client side issues.
We will discuss these topics both from theoretical and practical perspectives. Throughout the course we will also discuss agile development best practices and have an opportunity to implement many as we complete projects.
Discussions will focus on best practices highlighted with relevant, industry accepted approaches. The vast majority of frameworks and tools featured will come from best-of-breed open source projects. We will look at these projects not only to understand how they can be successfully used, but also critically on how they fail to address the core challenges of modern web application development.

	<td class="section">Prerequisites</td>
	<td class="description">
		<p>
			This course assumes existing knowledge of and experience with modern development practices such as
			integrated development environments (IDEs), debugging, source code compilation, and build tools. The course will be tought using the following technologies and libraries:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Groovy and Grails</li>
			<li>Javascript, Grunt, Underscore and AngularJS</li>
			<li>HTML, CSS, Less and Twitter Bootstrap</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			No previous experience with these technologies is required.  However, students who are not familiar with basic web development concepts or object-oriented languages will may need to spend extra time coming up to speed or
			working through issues.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will discuss many more technologies and compare them to the ones that are being covered.  Students are encouraged to explore other technologies and optionally use them to build their application if desired.

	<td class="section">Programming Assignments</td>
	<td class="description">
	<p>
	The course is designed around 4 programming assignments which are to be completed throughout the semester.
	Topics will be covered in a sequence which aligns with the due dates of the programming assignments.
	</p>
	<p>
	The programming assignments will be completed in two person teams. Each assignment will be focused on a core
	set of application development concepts (such as data, UI, integration, etc). Each assignment will require successful
	implementation of core requirements with functioning code and in some cases usable application. Requirements must be
	 confirmed via unit tests to receive full credit.
	</p>
	<p>
	Programming assignments will be due and must be submitted via email to Instructor before midnight on the due date.
	Programming assignments can be submitted either as an archive (zip) file or by giving the instructors access to
	the source code repository where your team's code is stored.  The assignemnts must build and run without any
	special help outside of normal Grails build, test and run commands.  If your project requires anything special (this
	is strongly discouraged), you must provide these instructions or your assignment will be deemed late until the point
	you provide the correct instructions or fix the error.

	<td class="section">Class Format</td>
	<td class="description">
	The class will be conducted in a lecture - discussion format. Lectures will serve to introduce, clarify, and
	extend the reading materials, but will not necessarily cover all the material in the assigned reading. Much of the
	in-class lecture time will be spent reviewing code examples and writing code related to the discussed topic.
	Students with access to a laptop computer will find it useful to bring their laptop to class and attempt reviewed
	techniques for themselves in class.

<tr>
	<td class="section">Grading</td>
	<td class="description">
		<p>
			The final grade will be determined based entirely on the programmng assignments.
			Each assignment will carry equal weight (25%).
		</p>
		<p>
			Students are required to submit all four assignments to pass the course.
		</p>
		<p>
			Assignments can be turned in late. For each week that an assignment is late, the total possible grade will be
			lowered by a full letter (for example an assignment turned in 1 week late can receive a maximum score of a "B").
			Lateness is based on a full week basis. For example, any assignment turned in after the due date/time but
			before 7 days after the due date and time will be considered 1 week late.
		</p>
		<p>
			Programming assignments will be graded on their successful implementation of assignment requirements.
			A grade of "A" will be earned only if all requirements are implemented and verified (by unit tests for non UI)
			requirements. Simply having compiling code or working code will not suffice for full credit.
		</p>
		<p>
			The class is not graded on a curve.

	<td class="description">
	<p>
		All assignments will be group assignments, with individual peer assessments. You may discuss the
      	assignments in general terms among yourselves or on the class forum, but
      	you must not share specific assignment deliverables outside the group that
      	is to be credited with the work.
	</p>
	<p>
      	Programming assignments require involvement and effort by both team members.
      	Ideally, work will be divided as equally as possible.

	<td class="section">Incompletes</td>
	<td class="description">
	Incompletes will only be given on request, and then only if you have substantially completed the class.
    For example, if you were seriously ill during the final exam period, you could request an incomplete.
    Incompletes must be made up before the middle of the following semester, and as a practical matter,
    the longer you wait to clear an incomplete, the less likely it is that you would succeed.

<tr>
	<td class="section">Expected Workload</td>
	<td class="description">
		<p>
			You can expect to spend on average 4-6 hours/week outside of class on reading and assignments.

		<p>
			You may find that weeks when projects are due may require spikes of increased time and effort.
