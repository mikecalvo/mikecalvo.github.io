# Why Groovy/Grails?
- Easy transition for Java developers
- Based on many tried and true technologies
  -- Hibernate
  -- Spring
- Significantly easier than building Java-based web application
- Dynamic languages are dominating the web

# Why AngularJS?
- JavaScript development used to suck
- People realized it's not going anywhere
- Great frameworks and patterns emerged
- Single-page apps are what people expect
- AngularJS is the most widely adopted single-page app framework today
