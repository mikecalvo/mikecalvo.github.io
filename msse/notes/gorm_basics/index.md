# GORM Basics

# GORM
- Grails Object Relational Mapping
- Simplifies use of Hibernate
- Convention-based
- Best suited for green field data models

---

# GORM Values
- No SQL
- No XML
- No Annodations
- Reasonable defaults
- DRY

---

# GORM Basics
- Domain classes live in grails-app/domain
- Class maps to a table
- Properties map to columns
- Long type autogenerated property id added to all classes
- All properties are mapped by default

---

# Property Mappings
- GORM provides reasonable type-column mappings for common types
- Integer, String, Float, Date, URL, byte[]
- Custom mappings can be defined if required

---

# Auditing Properties
- Grails treats dateCreated and lastUpdated properties specially
- If defined, these properties are automatically set on save with the current timestamp

---

# Example Domain Class
```
class User {
  String email
  String password
  Date dateCreated
}
```

---

# GORM Provides
- Automatic mapping of domain class to table
- All properties are automatically mapped to columns
- A Long value 'id' property added to all domain classes
  - id property is auto generated on create operation

---

# CRUD Operations
- Grails automatically adds static and instance methods for:
  - Create: instance method save()
  - Read: static methods get(id) and read(id)
  - Update: instance method save()
  - Delete: instance method delete()

---

# Domain Integration Tests
- Integration tests create a Grails environment complete with in memory database
- Testing GORM functionality is not interesting
- Verifying the configuration of GORM is
  - It can become very complex with relationships, constraints, and cascades
- Domain classes should be tested with integration tests

---

# Create Domain Integration Test
- Prove that the value is saved and an id is generated

```
  def 'saving user persists new user in database'() {
    setup:
    def user = new User(email: 'mike@calvo.com', password: '123456')

    when:
    user.save()

    then:
    user.errors.errorCount == 0
    user.id
    user.dateCreated
    User.get(user.id).email == 'mike@calvo.com'
  }
```
---

# 'Silent Failure'
- No exception is thrown if the save fails by default
- failOnError: true can be passed to save() to cause it
- After failure the errors property is populated on the instance with information regarding failure
- This can be the source of frustration for those new to Grails

---

# Update Domain Integration Test
```
def 'updating a user changes data'() {
  setup:
  def user = new User(email: 'joe@smith.com', password: '7654321').save(failOnError: true)
  user.save(failOnError: true)

  when:
  def foundUser = User.get(user.id)
  foundUser.password = 'secure'
  foundUser.save(failOnError: true)

  then:
  User.get(user.id).password == 'secure'
}
```

---

# Delete Domain Integration Test
```
def 'deleting an existing user removes it from the database'() {
  setup:
  def user = new User(email: 'pat@ska.com', password: 'skillz')
  user.save(failOnError: true)

  when:
  user.delete()

  then:
  !User.exists(user.id)
}
```

# Create/Update
- The behavior of save() depends on the id property
  - null id results in a create
  - non-null id results in an update
- After successful save
  - id property is guaranteed to have a non-null value
  - if they exist dateCreated and lastUpdated will have values

---

# Constraints
- Place constraints on the properties in domain class
- Conceptually similar to database constraints
- Constraints are automatically checked by GORM before saves
- GORM adds a validate() instance on domain classes which can be called without saving

---

# Example Constraints
  - Nullable
  - Min and max sizes
  - Unique
  - Regular expression patterns (url, email)

---

# GORM Constraints
- Declare a static constraints closure in your domain class
- Each property can be specified with a list of constraints
- By default properties are not nullable - must be declared as such

---

# Domain Constraints Example
```
class User {

  String email
  String password
  String status
  Date dateCreated

  static constraints = {
    email nullable: false, email: true, unique: true
    password nullable: false, size: 6..12
    status nullable: true, size: 0..64
  }
}
```
---

# Domain Constraints Example Test
```
def 'saving a user with invalid properties fails to validate'() {
  setup:
  def user = new User(email: 'not', password: '123', status: 'a'*200)

  when:
  def result = user.save()

  then:
  !result
  user.hasErrors()
  user.errors.errorCount == 3
  user.errors.getFieldError('email').rejectedValue == 'not'
}
```
---

# Other Validators
- blank: for strings prevents nulls or empty string
- inList: is one of a range of values
- validator: custom validation with a closure
- matches: regular expression

---

# Sharing Constraints
- importFrom constraint takes a domain type and a set of constraints to include or exclude
- Example:
```
static constraints {
  importFrom User, include ['password']
}
```

---

# GORM Relationships
- Domain classes can be related to each other
- Cardinality models relationship
  - Instance -> Collection: one-to-many
  - Instance -> Instance: one-to-one
  - Collection -> Collection: many-to-many
- Directionality: one-way vs bi-directional

---

# One-to-one Relationships
- hasOne declares that one instance belongs to this domain class
- Owned side simply has a reference to an instance of an owner
- Relationships can have constraints

---

# Example One-to-one

```
class User {
  static hasOne = [profile: Profile]
  static constraints = {
    profile nullable:true
  }
}

class Profile {
  User user
  String fullName
}
```

---

# One-to-many Relationships
- Model relationships of 1*n cardinality
- For example: Order has Line Items
- The one side defines hasMany map listing the relationship name and type
- The many side defines belongsTo map listing the relationship name and type of one side

---

# Example One-to-many
```
class Order {
  Date orderDate
  static hasMany = [lines: OrderLine]
}

class OrderLine {
  Integer number
  Integer quantity
  String sku
  static belongsTo = [order: Order]
}
```

---

# Lazy and Eager Fetching
- By default GORM uses a lazy fetch pattern for collection relationships
- The collection is not retrieved as part of retrieving the owning instance
- It is retrieved when the relationship is first accessed on the owning instance
  - This happens when someone references the property

---

# Eager Fetching
- The related items are fetched with the owning instance
- Eager fetching can be forced on collections
- By default one-to-one relationships are eager fetched

---

# Cascading
- Cascading affects how and when related objects are saved or deleted
- A cascade only occurs on objects with belongsTo defined
- For example, when an Order is deleted, all of its corresponding OrderLines are also deleted

---

# Adding and Removing
- GORM automatically adds methods for adding and removing related objects when a hasMany is defined
  - addTo<PropertyName>s
  - removeFrom<PropertyName>s
- For example
  - Order.addToLines()
  - Order.removeFromLines()

---

# Sorting Many Side
- By default, has many stores related items in a set
- To keep items in order, Grails provides the mapping closure
- The many side can define the property and direction for how it should be sorted
- The one side can define a mapping closure with sort the sort property

---

# Example Sorted One-to-many
```
class Order {
  Date orderDate
  static hasMany = [lines: OrderLine]
  static mapping {
    lines sort:'lineNumber' // this affects Order.lines.each calls
  }
}

class OrderLine {
  Integer number
  Integer quantity
  String sku
  static belongsTo = [order: Order]
  static mapping {
    sort number:'asc'  // this affects OrderLine queries
  }
}
```

---

# Many-to-many Relationships
- Use hasMany on both sides of a many-to-many relationship
- The owned side of the relationship should also have a belongsTo defined
- Many-to-many can also be self-referring
- Cascading with many-to-many works just like it does with one-to-many
  - Cascades only happen when a belongsTo exists

---

# Self-referring Many-to-many Example
```
class User {
  static hasMany = [followers : User, following : User]
  // This will have addToFollowers, removeFromFollowers,
  //   addToFollowing, removeFromFollowing
  // Updates will not cascade to followers or following
}
```
