Provide functional tests that work with one of the following browsers: Firefox, Chrome, Safari, or PhantomJS

  - DO NOT USE Internet Explorer

Provide a README file in the root of your project with any system expectations your project requires

  - Example: Chrome must be installed

<strong>Strongly recommended:</strong>
