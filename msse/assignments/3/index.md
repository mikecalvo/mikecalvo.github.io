### Due Date: 4/8/2017

# Assignment Overview
In this assignment you will build on the domain and controller project started in assignments 1 and 2 to create a simple single page app user interface using AngularJS.  All requirements should be verified using Geb functional tests against a running Spring Boot application.

Feel free to use your creativity to build a usable and attractive web UI.  However, points will not be subtracted for 'ugly but functional implementations'.

The Navigation requirements are for providing a global way (available on every page) to navigate to commonly used screens or functionality.  Think about having a global navigation header, footer or side panel on each screen (doesn't matter which you pick).  These navigation controls can be text links, images or buttons.
